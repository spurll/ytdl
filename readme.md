ytdl
====

A web application for downloading audio/video from YouTube. Basically just a web wrapper
for [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) with a stripped-down feature set.

Usage
=====

Installation
------------

You'll need to install [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/). It's
recomended that you keep it updated (e.g., via a cron job).

```
youtube-dl -U
```

You'll also need to install ffmpeg/avconv.

Requirements
------------

* flask
* flask-wtf
* [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/)
* ffmpeg

Starting the Server
-------------------

Start the server with `run.py`. By default it will be accessible at `localhost:9999`. To
make the server world-accessible or for other options, see `run.py -h`.

If you're having trouble configuring your sever, I wrote a
[blog post](http://blog.spurll.com/2015/02/configuring-flask-uwsgi-and-nginx.html)
explaining how you can get Flask, uWSGI, and Nginx working together.
